# PhotoMapper v2.0
Refactored improved version of the 2023 SpaceApps Project

## What's different?
* In the original project, due to time constraints most of the code was written in the front-end
* Includes a new toggle between normal map and wildfire mode (developing a photomap generator underneath)
* New security update: uses .env file to access APIs rather than an external .js file

## Known Bugs
* Result only prints if successful find of hotspot data
* Missing photo pin dropping
* Missing toggle between fire and normal mode
